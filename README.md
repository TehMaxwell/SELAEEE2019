#SELA EEE Activity 2019

This repository contains the development files for the SELA EEE Activity designed for the GUTS Fair in Rotherham in March.
The activity comprises a arcade style cabinet where users line up a model of a communications satellite with a lunar base, users
then have to modulate a signal until communication is "established" between the base and the earth satellite. This exhibit is aimed
at teaching secondary school students about the importance and applications of Electronic and Electrical Engineering through the
example of communications in space.

##SINE Wave Software

This software allows users to modulate a simple Amplitude Modulated signal in order to "establish" communication with a Lunar Base.
The aim is to teach students about communication electronics and the sort of signals that are used to communicate in space.
